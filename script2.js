//NODE JS
//POINTS TO REMEMBER : 
//1.not a prog lang,not a technology,not a software
//2.it is a js runtime environment
//(back in time) - we cant create backend from js because js doesnt have those functionalites through which backend can be made
//ryan dahl - wants js to have backend service
//google chrome's v8 engine is open sourced and ryan dahl uses it manipulate 
//code of v8 engine = c++ but ryan dahl wants to do it js
// js code -> js wrapper layer -> creates server wtih v8 cpp modules 
// the wrapper around v8 engine and v8 engine as total is nodejs
//nodejs is a js runtime environment
//till nodejs runs,we can create server through js
